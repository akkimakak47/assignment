property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.

Q-11 How to center block elements using css1?

> To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the <center> tag. All the elements within the
 <center> tag will be centrally aligned.

 Q-12 how to maintain the css specifications?

 > The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Even though every browser
supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the supported specification version. Some browsers even have
their own implementation of the specification and have proprietary (vendor) prefixes.

Q-13 what are the ways to integrate css as a web page?

> CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS
in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal
stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.

Q-14 what is embedded style sheet?

> An embedded style sheet is declared within the <head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole document, 
rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.

EXAMPLE:-
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>

            <head>
                <title>Page Title</title>

                <!-- Embedded stylesheet -->
                <style>
                    h2 {
                        font-size: 1.5rem;
                        color: #2f8d46;
                        text-align: center;
                    }

                    p {
                        font-variant: italic;
                    }
                </style>
            </head>

        <body>
            <h2>Welcome To GFG</h2>
            <p>This document is using an embedded stylesheet!</p>
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
            <p>This is another paragraph</p>
        </body>

        </html>

Q-15 what is external style sheet?

> An external style sheet is a file with a . css extension that contains cascading style sheet (CSS) definitions
for a webpage(s). It completely separates the CSS styles from the HTML document making it easy to reuse and maintain.

EXAMPLE:-

Q-16 what are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?

ADVANTAGE:-

> With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.
> In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.
> In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.

 DISADVANTAGE:-

> An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.
> The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.
> While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.

Q-17 what is the meaning of the css selector?

> It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to
have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.

 EXAMPLE:-
        h1 {
        color: blue;
        }

        .special {
        color: blue;
        }

 Q-18 what are the media types allowed by css?

> The Media query in CSS is used to create a responsive web design. It means that the view of a web page differs
from system to system based on screen or media types. The breakpoint specifies for what device-width size, the
content is just starting to break or deform.

> all: It is used for all media devices
